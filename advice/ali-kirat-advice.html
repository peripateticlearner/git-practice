                <h4>Stepping into the Unknown!</h4>
                <p>This advice is mainly geared toward a newbie, one that has written little to no code, and is embarking on
                     a new journey. I know that stepping into the unknown can be a challenge and even scary. Just remember 
                     the reasons why you chose to embark on this path. Maybe you felt that you were stuck on a career that 
                     you felt didn’t give you the quality of life you wanted, or maybe you wanted to get into a career in 
                     which you had more control of how far you wanted to go and what you want to create. Or maybe it’s just 
                     been something you always dreamed of doing. Whatever your reasons may have been, let it be your 
                     motivation. Take time to write, design, and beautify your reasons, and even frame them. Place this 
                     motivation in your work area, and one in your room.</p>

                <h4>You are not alone.</h4>
                <p>Remember that you are not alone. You have joined a community where so many people are embarked on this 
                    journey along with you. Many have started exactly where you are, with a blank canvas, not yet having 
                    figured out what painting they will draw or what it will even look like. Build connections with them, 
                    join the slack community and let it be your beacon, reminding you, that you are not alone.
                </p>
                <h4>It will be challenging.</h4>
                <p>Let me assure you now, you will get stuck, you will want to cry at times because you just can’t figure 
                    out the reason why the code isn’t working. You will have looked over your code a hundred times, and 
                    still can’t figure out why it’s not working how you want it. Do you feel like you’re ready to give up? 
                    Well, guess what, you’re part of the Skillcrush community. Just take a deep breath, hop on slack and 
                    ask away. You’ll find your problem will magically turn into a solution. The Skillcrush community will 
                    be your closest thing to Aladdin’s lamp. All you have to do is make a wish!</p>
                
                <h4>You got this!</h4>
                <p>Well Skillcrusher, it’s time to push forward. You now have the tools to make your dreams come true.
